# Encrypted websocket chat

[First version written in python](https://github.com/ArtyomArtamonov/EncryptedWebsocketChat)

This version should be at least like the previous one. I hope to make it better though. 

Goals:
- AES and RSA encryption ✔
- Any message length ✔
- Readable code (You be the judge)
- Decent user interface
- Less external packages is better

Feel free to contribute ❤
